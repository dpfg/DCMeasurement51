Duty cycle measurement on Intel8051 microcontroller

This is my cours project in the university on the subject "Digital and Microprocessor Devices".
Subject of the course project is to design a measurement duty cycle signal. 
I used an Intel8051-based microcontroller. 
Task has been done in the ISIS Proteus. Project files is attached.
